Bioinformatics in Drug Discovery: Leveraging Machine Learning and Data Analysis

**PROBLEM STATEMENT & PRIMARY OBJECTIVES**

**Problem Statement:** The emergence of the SARS coronavirus and its variants
poses a critical global health threat, demanding the creation of efficient
therapeutics.
Conventional drug discovery methods are slow and expensive, relying heavily on
experimental testing. However, employing bioinformatics, machine learning, and
computational methods can accelerate this process by pinpointing promising drug
candidates with favorable pharmacological traits.

**Primary Objectives:**
This project aims to use bioinformatics, machine learning, and computational
techniques to find potential drugs targeting the SARS coronavirus 3C-like
proteinase. It involves:

• Retrieving and preprocessing bioactivity data from databases like
ChEMBL.
• Calculating molecular descriptors to assess drug-likeness and predict
pharmacokinetic properties.
• Developing machine learning models to predict compound bioactivity
against the SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase.
• Identifying lead compounds with promising pharmacological profiles for
further experimental validation and drug development. Ultimately, the
project seeks to contribute to discovering effective treatments for
coronavirus infections.
